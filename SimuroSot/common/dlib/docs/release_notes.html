            <table cellspacing="5" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td width="15"></td><td><pre>
New Features:
  - Added more overloads of find_max_factor_graph_potts() to make applying it 
    over a Markov random field of image pixels really simple.
  - Added overloads of serialize()/deserialize() so that they can serialize
    Google protocol buffer objects.
  - Image Processing:
      - Added find_points_above_thresh()
      - Added max_filter() 
      - Added scan_image_movable_parts()
      - Added sum_filter_assign()
      - Added the full_object_detection object.
      - Added the ability to model objects with movable parts into the
        scan_image_pyramid object.  This update also includes all the needed tools
        to train movable part models using the structural_object_detection_trainer.
  - Machine Learning:
      - Added a per node loss option to the structural_svm_graph_labeling_problem's
        interface.
      - Added Emanuele Cesena's implementation of Sammon's nonlinear dimensionality
        reduction method.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
  - To support movable part models, the serialization format of scan_image_pyramid
    objects was modified.  This breaks backwards compatibility with the previous
    format for scan_image_pyramid objects as well as object_detector instances
    that use the scan_image_pyramid.

Bug fixes:
  - Fixed a bug in auto_threshold_image() that caused it to give bad outputs 
    when used with very large images.

Other:
  - Updated find_max_factor_graph_potts() to correctly say you can use infinite
    weights for the factor_value_disagreement() values since the code actually
    supports this.
  - Made integer serialization about 3 times faster.

</pre></td></tr></table><hr><h1 style="margin:0px;">Release 17.47</h1><u>Release date</u>: Jun 15, 2012<br><u>Major Changes in this Release</u>:
            <table cellspacing="5" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td width="15"></td><td><pre>
New Features:
   - Improvements to linear algebra tools:
      - Added the lowerbound() and upperbound() routines for thresholding dense 
        matrices.
      - Refined the tools for working with sparse vectors.  In particular, 
        the following functions were added: min(), max(), make_sparse_vector(),
        add(), and subtract().  A number of existing routines were also updated
        to work with both sparse and dense vectors so that templated code which 
        works on both vector types is simpler to write.
      - Added the += and -= operators to the set_subm(), set_rowm(), and set_colm()
        tools for operating on submatrices.
   - Optimization:
      - Added a new quadratic program solver, solve_qp4_using_smo().  This new
        solver is useful for solving quadratic programs corresponding to
        non-negative constrained primal quadratic programs.
      - Added an optional non-negativity constraint to the oca optimizer.
      - Added the min_cut object.  It provides a method to find the minimum weight 
        cut on a graph.  
      - Added tools for finding the maximum probability assignment in a Potts 
        style Markov random field.  See the find_max_factor_graph_potts() routine 
        for details.
   - Machine Learning:
      - Added structural SVM tools for learning the parameters of a Potts style
        Markov random field.  See the structural_graph_labeling_trainer and
        graph_labeler objects as well as their associated example program for 
        details.
      - Added the ability to learn only non-negative weights to the 
        svm_c_linear_trainer.
   - Improved Integration with OpenCV: 
      - Updated the cv_image object so it works with cv::Mat as well as IplImage.
      - Added the toMat() routine for converting from a dlib style image to an
        OpenCV cv::Mat image.

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Removed the dlib::sparse_vector namespace.  Everything from this namespace 
     was moved into the normal dlib:: namespace so that code which works with 
     both sparse and dense vectors is more cohesive.

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed a bug in find_max_factor_graph_viterbi() which sometimes occurred when 
     the model order was larger than the number of variables.
   - Fixed a bug which caused a compiler error if you tried to call dot() on two 
     1x1 matrices which were statically dimensioned.

Other:
   - Improved existing documentation: added pictures of the gui widgets, 
     added documentation of the dlib::bridge protocol, and other minor 
     usability improvements.
</pre></td></tr></table><hr><h1 style="margin:0px;">Release 17.46</h1><u>Release date</u>: Apr 11, 2012<br><u>Major Changes in this Release</u>:
            <table cellspacing="5" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td width="15"></td><td><pre>
New Features:
   - Image Processing:
      - Added the option to make the features generated by poly_image rotationally 
        invariant. 
      - Added a set of routines for warping, scaling, and resizing images.
        See the new "Scaling and Rotating" section of the image processing
        documentation for details.
      - Added the heatmap() routine for converting an image into a heatmap.
   - Machine Learning
      - Updated the sequence labeling trainer to allow the user to set different 
        loss values for different labels.
      - Added the rls object.  It is an implementation of the linear recursive 
        least squares algorithm.
   - Added the get_option() routines which slightly simplify option parsing 
     from the command line and config files.
   - Added the 128bit version of Murmur hash.
   - Added the kalman_filter and rls_filter objects.  These are tools for 
     performing Kalman filtering and recursive least squares filtering.
   - Added the circular_buffer object. 

Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - The poly_image generates slightly different features in this new release.
     Therefore, classifiers trained using the previous version will need to be
     retrained if they are switched to the new version of poly_image.
   - Changed the xcorr() functions so they take the complex conjugate of the right
     hand arguments if they are complex numbers.  This way they do a proper
     cross-correlation and also mirror the behavior of MATLAB.  However, this
     breaks backwards compatibility with the previous behavior of xcorr().
   - Previously, dlib included two versions of dlib::array.  However, to
     simplify the user interface, dlib now includes only the contiguous
     memory implementation of dlib::array.  This change should only affect
     you if you wrote code which assumed dlib::array::set_max_size() only
     allocated a small amount of RAM.  The new behavior is similar to the
     std::vector::reserve() routine.  That is, dlib::array::set_max_size()
     will allocate the requested amount of memory immediately.

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed a bug which caused certain matrix expressions to not compile
     when the BLAS bindings were enabled.  In particular, expressions which
     involved a 1x1 matrix sometimes didn't compile.

Other:
   - Made the matrix routines min(), max(), sum() and mean() work with 
     complex numbers. 
   - Turned the array object into a single implementation object.  Now arrays 
     can be created using the normal array&lt;type&gt; obj; syntax.  Additionally, 
     all extensions were merged into the array object. 
   - Added an example program which better documents how to create training
     data for the object detection tools as well as how this data can be used.
     See the train_object_detector.cpp example for details.

</pre></td></tr></table><hr><h1 style="margin:0px;">Release 17.45</h1><u>Release date</u>: Jan 29, 2012<br><u>Major Changes in this Release</u>:
            <table cellspacing="5" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td width="15"></td><td><pre>
New Features:
   - Added tools for timing blocks of code
   - Machine Learning
      - Added a set of tools for learning to solve the assignment problem.
        See the structural_assignment_trainer and its associated example
        program for an introduction.
      - Added random projection based locality sensitive hashing tools.
      - Added tools to simplify the creation of scan_image_pyramid objects.  
        See the object_detector_ex.cpp example program for details.
   - Image Processing
      - Added sum_filter() and spatially_filter_image_separable_down()
      - New feature extractors: poly_image, nearest_neighbor_feature_image, and
        fine_hog_image
 
Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Changed the serialization format for rand objects.
   - Changed the order of arguments for the sequence_labeler's constructor.
   - Object Detection Changes
      - Some parts of the object detection tools have been refactored.  In particular, 
        the interfaces of the scan_image_pyramid and structural_object_detection_trainer 
        have been changed slightly to improve usability.
      - Made the test_box_overlap a little more flexible.  This change breaks
        backwards compatibility with the previous version though.
      - The hashed_feature_image object has been made more general.  It now 
        uses a user supplied hashing function rather than its own hashing 
        implementation.
      - Removed constness from the operator() member functions of the 
        object_detector.
   - Fixed improper normalization in the gaussian() functions.  The
     normalization constant was being computed incorrectly.
   - Sequence labeling feature extractors must now define a sequence_type
     typedef instead of sample_type.  This change allows the user to use any 
     type of sequence, not just std::vector objects.

Bug fixes:
   - Changed the add_probability() method of joint_probability_table so
     it does a saturating add rather than a normal add.  This ensures the
     probability value stays exactly &lt;= 1.  Previously, floating point
     rounding error could cause it to be slightly above 1 and would therefore
     cause some asserts to misfire during debugging mode.
   - The object_detector had code in it which limited the number of outputs
     to 100 rectangles.  This has been removed.
   - Fixed improper normalization in the gaussian() functions.  The
     normalization constant was being computed incorrectly.

Other:
   - dlib::rand can now generate Gaussian random numbers.
   - The structural_object_detection_trainer will now automatically setup
     appropriate non-max suppression parameters if the user doesn't supply them. 
   - The structural_object_detection_trainer has been optimized and now runs
     significantly faster than in previous dlib releases.
   - The tools folder containing htmlify, imglab, and mltool is now included
     in the dlib release archive files.  Previously, these tools were only 
     available directly from source control.

            <table cellspacing="5" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td width="15"></td><td><pre>
New Features:
   - Machine Learning
      - Added the histogram intersection kernel for sparse and dense vectors.
      - Added a set of tools to allow a user to easily learn to do sequence
        labeling using dlib's structural SVM implementation.  See the new
        sequence_labeler object and its associated example program for an 
        introduction.
   - Image processing:  
      - Added segment_image()
      - Added randomly_color_image()
      - Added the border_enumerator
   - Added the disjoint_subsets object, it is an implementation of the 
     union-find algorithm/disjoint-set data structure.
   - Added new matrix routines: conv(), conv_same(), conv_valid(), xcorr(),
     xcorr_same(), xcorr_valid(), and flip().
 
Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Changed find_max_factor_graph_viterbi() so you can use run-time
     defined order and num_states parameters.

Bug fixes:
   - The last dlib release added a max_iterations parameter to the
     svm_c_linear_trainer and svm_c_ekm_trainer objects.  However,
     there was a bug which made them only do at most 16 iterations,
     which is too few to solve many problems.  This has been fixed.
   - Fixed a bug in is_const_type.  It didn't work for reference types.
   - Fixed a bug in the SQLite binding routine statement::get_column_as_text().  
     It didn't work correctly if the column contained a NULL.
   - Fixed a bug in find_max_factor_graph_viterbi() which occurred when a
     zero order model had negative factor values.

            <table cellspacing="5" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td width="15"></td><td><pre>
New Features:
   - Two new routines for performing MAP inference in factor graphs:
      - For chain-structured graphs: find_max_factor_graph_viterbi()
      - For general graphs:          find_max_factor_graph_nmplp()
   - Image Processing
      - Added more tools for creating image pyramids.  See pyramid_down_5_4, 
        pyramid_down_4_3, and pyramid_down_3_2.
      - Added more image filtering and morphology functions.
      - Added a set of tools for creating sliding window classifiers:
         - Added the scan_image() routine.  It is a tool for sliding a set of 
           rectangles over an image space and finding the locations where the sum 
           of pixels in the rectangles exceeds a threshold.  Also added
           scan_image_pyramid, which is a tool for running scan_image() over an 
           image pyramid.
         - Added the structural_object_detection_trainer.  This is a tool which 
           formulates the sliding window classifier learning problem as an
           instance of structural SVM learning.
         - Added a variety of supporting tools and two object detection example 
           programs.
   - Added the following functions for computing statistics on vectors:
     mean_sign_agreement(), correlation(), covariance(), r_squared(),
     and mean_squared_error()
   - Added a C++ wrapper for SQLite (see the new database and statement objects)
 
Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Changed the interface to the ridge regression trainer objects so that they 
     report the entire set of leave-one-out prediction values rather than a 
     summary statistic like mean squared error.
   - Changed the serialization routine for bgr_pixels to store the pixels in BGR 
     order rather than RGB.
   - Changed the interface for the spatially_filter_image() routine to take the 
     filter as a matrix rather than C-array.  Also, now it won't force signed pixel 
     values to 0 if they go negative. 
   - Changed the test_regression_function() and cross_validate_regression_trainer()
     routines so they return both the MSE and R-squared values rather than just the
     MSE.
   - Changed suppress_non_maximum_edges() to use the L2 norm instead of L1 norm
     for measuring the strength of an edge since this produces a slightly better
     result.

Bug fixes:
   - The image_display didn't display overlay rectangles quite right.  If you zoomed
     in you could see that some of the pixels which are inside the rectangle were
     outside the overlay.  Specifically, the right column and bottom row was outside
     the overlay rectangle.  This has been fixed.  Now all pixels which are supposed
     to be part of a rectangle are drawn as being inside the overlay rectangle.
   - Fixed a bug pointed out by Martin Müllenhaupt which caused the windows socket
     code to not compile when used with the mingw-cross-env project.
   - Fixed a bug in the png_loader.  If you loaded an image with an alpha channel 
     into something without an alpha channel there were uninitialized values being 
     alpha blended into the image.
   - Fixed a bug in the cpp_tokenizer that only shows up on newer versions of gcc.  
     It wasn't tokenizing double quoted strings right.
   - Fixed a bug in spatially_filter_image() which showed up when using non-square 
     filters.  The bug would cause the edges of the output image to be incorrect.
   - Fixed a bug in the matrix class.  Expressions of the form mat *= mat(0) would
     evaluate incorrectly because the *= operator took the right hand side by reference
     and thus experienced an aliasing problem.  The other op= operators had similar
     problems and have also been fixed.
   - Fixed a bug pointed out by Justin Solomon which could cause the svr_trainer and
     svm_c_trainer to produce incorrect results in certain unusual cases.  

Other:
   - Added a more complete set of methods for converting between image space and 
     the downsampled hog grid used by hog_image.  Now you can convert from image 
     to hog in addition to hog to image.
   - Made the integral_image more general by making it templated on the type of 
     scalar used to store the sums.

            <table cellspacing="5" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td width="15"></td><td><pre>
New Features:
   - Added the check_sub_option() method to the command line parser check
     object.
   - Added match_endings to the dir_nav utils.
   - Added a set_current_dir() function.
   - Added the distance_to_rect_edge() routine.
   - Added support for user drawn rectangle overlays and selectable overlays 
     to the image_display widget.
 
Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed a bug in the image_display widget.  If you switched it between
     images of a different size while any kind of zoom was in effect
     it could cause a segmentation fault.

            <table cellspacing="5" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td width="15"></td><td><pre>
New Features:
   - You can now add tasks to a thread_pool by value, using the new 
     add_task_by_value() method.
 
Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:

Bug fixes:
   - Fixed a bug which caused multiply defined symbol errors during linking
     if the PNG saving routine was #included.

Other:
   - Optimized the threaded and distributed structural svm solvers for the 
     case where there are many data samples and the separation oracle is 
     quick to evaluate.

            <table cellspacing="5" cellpadding="0" width="100%"><tr><td width="15"></td><td><pre>
New Features:
   - Added a function for saving to the PNG image format.
   - Added Austin Appleby's excellent MurmurHash3 hashing code and setup some
     additional convenience functions.  These functions are murmur_hash3() and
     various overloads of hash().
 
Non-Backwards Compatible Changes:
   - Made get_pixel_intensity() more efficient.  However, the value returned
     is slightly different than it used to be for RGB pixel types.

Bug fixes:
   - Setup proper error handling for libpng in the png_loader.  Now if the PNG
     file is corrupted in the middle it won't just print a message and abort
     the program.
   - Fixed a bug in assign_pixel_intensity() that happened when the target pixel 
     was an RGB pixel with an alpha channel.

Other:
   - Added a Frequently Asked Questions page
   - Changed the array2d object so you don't have to say array2d&lt;type&gt;::kernel_1a
     anymore to declare it.  Now you just say array2d&lt;type&gt;.

   - Removed the DLIB_REVISION macro and replaced it with DLIB_MAJOR_VERSION and
     DLIB_MINOR_VERSION.

Bug fixes:

Other:
   - dlib's version control system has switched from Subversion to Mercurial.
